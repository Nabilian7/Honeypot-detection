# Honeypot-detection

Honeytrap is a security instrument intended to identify and forestall assaults on TCP and UDP
administrations. It works as a foundation daemon and dispatches server processes when an
association endeavor is made to a port. The instrument utilizes different strategies for activity to
deal with associations, including sending conflicting information to impersonate notable
conventions like TCP and UDP. This befuddles many robotized assault devices, which then, at
that point, go on with the assault. To upgrade the instrument's usefulness, a module has been
fostered that empowers custom expansions to be handily composed and stacked into the device.
The device gathers assault information into an assault string, which can be saved to documents
or a SQL data set for manual examination and further activity.

6. Proposed System
6.1 Objective of the Project:
The objective of the Honeypot deception method for real-time intrusion detection and prevention
is to create a trap that appears to be a legitimate target for attackers, but in reality, is designed to
detect and prevent malicious activity. A Honeypot is a decoy system that is set up to attract
attackers and provide an environment where their actions can be observed and analyzed. The goal
is to learn about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of attackers in order to improve
security defenses and prevent future attacks.
Honeypots are often used as a proactive security measure to detect and respond to attacks in realtime. They can be deployed on internal networks, external-facing systems, or in the cloud, and can
be customized to simulate a wide range of services and applications. By mimicking legitimate
systems, Honeypots can lure attackers into a controlled environment where their behavior can be
monitored and analyzed without risking damage to the actual production systems.
The use of Honeypots can provide valuable insight into the threat landscape, help identify new
attack vectors, and improve incident response capabilities. By deploying Honeypots, organizations
can gain a better understanding of their own vulnerabilities and improve their overall security
posture. Additionally, Honeypots can help organizations meet compliance requirements by
providing a mechanism to detect and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.


6.2 Novelty of the Project:
 The Honeypot Double dealing Technique for Continuous Interruption Discovery and
Counteraction project has a few novel perspectives:
1. Honeypot Innovation: The task uses honeypot innovation to distinguish and forestall
interruptions. Honeypots are imitation frameworks that are intended to seem as though
genuine frameworks yet are phony. By conveying honeypots, the undertaking can draw
assailants from genuine frameworks and catch significant data about their strategies,
methods, and methodology (TTPs).
2. Continuous Interruption Recognition: The undertaking utilizes ongoing interruption
location to recognize and answer assaults as they happen. This permits the undertaking to
rapidly answer assaults and forestall further harm.
3. Face Acknowledgment: The task utilizes face acknowledgment innovation to catch
pictures and recordings of gatecrashers. This innovation permits the venture to distinguish
gatecrashers and possibly connect them to different assaults.
4. Message and Gmail Administrations Mix: The undertaking coordinates with Wire and
Gmail administrations to advise security work force progressively when an interruption is
identified. This permits security staff to rapidly answer assaults and make a suitable move.
5. Moderate Code: The undertaking utilizes moderate Python code which makes it
lightweight, quick, and simple to introduce. This permits the task to run proficiently on
low-asset frameworks, like Raspberry Pi, and makes it open to a more extensive scope of
clients.
